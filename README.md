### Hi, I'm Shane 👋

A few of my projects:
- fork of openpilot, called Stock Additions with a [couple of cool features](https://github.com/shanesmiskol/openpilot#highlight-features) 🚗
- [Konverter](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/Konverter), a tool to konvert Keras models into Python files to inference on with just Python 🐍 and NumPy
- [A model to detect traffic lights](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/traffic-lights) 🚦 from a single image to display alerts in openpilot, along with a 27.6 GB database of traffic light images collected from users.
  - *Now deprecated mainly due to the optimizations that I didn't make that caused it to consume much too much CPU alongside openpilot. The database is still free to download*
